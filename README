This was the procedure to convert the csv files of the printed sources into JSON arrays.

    - all rmk and rmny files were concatenated into all_NAME.csv files
        - files were imported via mongochef
        - 11 documents tom 'rmk' collection
        - 34  documents 'rmny' collection
    - pages were converted to JSON files with pagesToJson.js
        - target: pagesJson/res.json
        - the script uses csvtojson npm package
        - in order to parse strings like. '0000' as strings the  'checkType : false'
            condition was added to the options
        - the resulting file is not a valid JSON array
            - the last ',' needs to be removed
            - the complete list needs to be placed in '[]'-s and formated
                accordingly
        - each line within a PAGE.csv was converted to a separate object
        - the name of the csv page files (i.e. the last part of MEK folder URL)
            was added to the objects as 'MEK_sub'
        - 640 documents were imported
